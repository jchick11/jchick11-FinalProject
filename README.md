Hello!

11/18 = Today I worked on trying to get my code up and working for the final project. I was able to do the neural network no problem although some things might need to be tweaked later. I cannot get the code from the actual paper to work in R Studio, VSCode as R, or in VSCode translated into Python. I'm going to have to work on it in R I believe. The R code makes more sense to me, but for some reason I cannot find the package they used to analyze their data.
